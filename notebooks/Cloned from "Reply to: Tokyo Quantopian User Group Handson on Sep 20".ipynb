    "## A brief foray into linear algebra\n",
    "Let's start with a basic overview of some linear algebra. Linear algebra comes down to the multiplication and composition of scalar and matrix values. A scalar value is just a real number that we multiply against an array. When we scale a matrix or array using a scalar, we multiply each individual element of that matrix or array by the scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix is a collection of values, typically represented by an $m \\times n$ grid, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns. The edge lengths $m$ and $n$ do not necessarily have to be different. If we have $m = n$, we call this a square matrix. A particularly interesting case of a matrix is when $m = 1$ or $n = 1$. In this case we have a special case of a matrix that we call a vector. While there is a matrix object in NumPy we will be doing everything using NumPy arrays because they can have dimensions greater than $2$. For the purpose of this section, we will be using matrix and array interchangeably.\n",

    "We can express the matrix equation as:\n",

    "Notice that the above-defined matrices, $A$ and $B$, have different dimensions. $A$ is $3 \\times 5$ and $B$ is $4 \\times 3$. The general rule of what can and cannot be multiplied in which order is based on the dimensions of the matrices. Specifically, the number of columns in the matrix on the left must be equal to the number of rows in the matrix on the right. In super informal terms, let's say that we have an $m \\times n$ matrix and a $p \\times q$ matrix. If we multiply the first by the second on the right, we get the following:\n",
