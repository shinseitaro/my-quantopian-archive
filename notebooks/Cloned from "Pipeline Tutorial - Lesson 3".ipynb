We can use the `SimpleMovingAverage` built-in factor which computes the average value of the input data (close price) over the specified window length (10 days). To do this, we need to import our built-in `SimpleMovingAverage` factor and the [USEquityPricing dataset](https://www.quantopian.com/help#importing-datasets)."
